= Today I Learned... (TIL)

Inspired from https://github.com/simonw/til[simonw's TILs] and discovered through his https://simonwillison.net/2020/Jul/10/self-updating-profile-readme/[self-update README blog post].

As per jbranchaud definition, TILs are:

[quote, jbranchaud, https://github.com/jbranchaud/til]
A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really warrant a full blog post.
