= Debug SaltStack state

When executing a state on `dom0`, just replace `qubesctl` by `salt-call -l debug` to get more insight on what happen during the state execution.

It is better to limit this usage to the execution of a single state with `state.sls`.

As an example:

```bash
sudo qubesctl state.sls path.to.my.state test=True
```

would become:

```bash
sudo salt-call -l debug state.sls path.to.my.state test=True
```
