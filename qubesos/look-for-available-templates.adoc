= Look for available templates

If you want to know which template VMs are available from Qubes OS repo, just issue the following command in dom0:

```bash
sudo qubes-dom0-update --action=search qubes-template
```

If you want to include also community template VMs then issue the following command in dom0 instead:

```bash
sudo qubes-dom0-update --enablerepo=qubes-templates-community --action=search qubes-template
```
