= Get Qube preferences and features with SaltStack

We all know that Qube Manager provide info about qubes but to retrieve these info (at least some of them) through SaltStack, just open a terminal in `dom0` and execute following commands:

* For preferences: `sudo qubesctl qvm.prefs <vm_name>`
* For features: `sudo qubesctl qvm.features <vm_name>`

Where `<vm_name>` is the name of the targeted qube.
