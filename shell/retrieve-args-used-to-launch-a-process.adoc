= Retrieve args used to launch a process

We sometimes need to know which command line has been used to launch a process.

To retrieve the entire command, just issue: `ps -p <pid> -o args` and you will get:

```
COMMAND
<the command line used to launch the process>
```

If you need to parse it programmatically, just pipe it with sed: `ps -p <pid> -o args | sed -n '2p'` to retrieve only the second line.
